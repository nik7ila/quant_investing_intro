Conclusion:
The correlation fluctuates but stays between 0.2 and 0.6 for most of the time.
It peaked near 0.65 in early 2023, meaning the two stocks behaved similarly at that point.

Conclusion:
AAPL and AMZN are close to or slightly under the threshold of 1, suggesting strong risk-adjusted returns.
TSLA has a decent Sharpe Ratio, though slightly lower.
DIS has a significantly lower Sharpe Ratio (~0.23), indicating it may not be providing good returns relative to its risk.

CONCLUSION:
This analysis highlights that AAPL and AMZN offer the best balance between returns and risk, 
making them attractive from a risk-adjusted performance perspective. 
TSLA provides high return potential but comes with high volatility. 
DIS, on the other hand, shows the lowest Sharpe Ratio and highest kurtosis, 
suggesting it may be less attractive for risk-conscious investors.
When considering diversification, pairing stocks like TSLA and DIS or 
AAPL and TSLA can reduce portfolio risk due to lower correlations. 
However, the fat tails and high kurtosis observed in all stocks mean extreme events are possible, 
so proper risk management is essential.
