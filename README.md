# quant_investing_intro
An applied walkthrough of quant investing basics in Python — Sharpe ratio, returns, and data analysis using real stock data.

This project explores the portfolio performance and risk metrics of four major US stocks — Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Disney (DIS), and Amazon (AMZN) — using Python. It is based on the article:
"The Science of Smart Investing: Portfolio Evaluation with Python"

Key Concepts Covered
Daily & Cumulative Returns
Skewness & Kurtosis
Standard Deviation (Volatility)
Correlation Matrix
Alpha & Beta (vs S&P 500)
Sharpe Ratio
Rolling Correlation

Tools Used
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance
quantstats, statsmodels
Google Colab for development

This is the first step in a broader quant finance portfolio. Future additions will include:
Portfolio optimization (Markowitz model)
Risk-adjusted performance benchmarking
Machine learning models for return prediction
